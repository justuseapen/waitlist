Description:
    Mounts this engine to /prelaunch.

Example:
    rails generate prelaunch:install

    This will create in config/routes.rb:
        mount Prelaunch::Engine => "/prelaunch"

    It also creates a migration in db/migrate that installs a
    `prelaunch_subscribers` table to collect addresses for your prelaunch
    waiting list.
