Description:
    Mounts this engine to /waitlist.

Example:
    rails generate waitlist:install

    This will create in config/routes.rb:
        mount Waitlist::Engine => "/waitlist"

    It also creates a migration in db/migrate that installs a
    `waitlist_subscribers` table to collect addresses for your pre-launch
    waiting list.
